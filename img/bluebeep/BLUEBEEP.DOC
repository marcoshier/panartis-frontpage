.TOPIC Introduction
.SUBTITLE Words from the reject called "author"

Yo everybody,

I am proud to be able to present you the latest, the one and only, the
unbelievable, innocent, colorful, phun-philled BlueBEEP, version 0.07· !

Released on the |CHoHoCon '93 |cparty held in Austin, TX winter 1993.

This version is nothing that a BlueBEEP that has less bugs, is more
compatible, and has more "little goodie" options to make your life
easier. A good example is the ALT-W (Worldtime) in the dialer. No
"major" features have been added, as I just cannot SEE any features
which I could add. Well, I could write a NUA attacker, a war dialer,
or something like that and add it in, but there are already very good
programs available for this purpose (eg. if you are looking for a good
wardialer, try ToneLoc). I could also have been writing nonsense features
(like a Tic-Tac-Toe in the dialbutton window of the dialer), but what
is it good for? Nuttin. This is a solid, working, almost bug-free,
comfortable and good-looking dialer. Chew it.

(If you find a feature you would like to see added, send mail, and
 I bet a million dollars that I will add it in, because there is
 nothing else to do on this thing.)

Basically, this release is a complete miracle, because somewhen in
September, every programmer's nightmare, a total devastation, the coders
personal horror show, a digital asassin took place in my tiny apartment
in the nice peaceful city of Hamburg, Germany. A trojan horse unleashed
its evil power and sent both of my hard drives to eternity, to the
hunting grounds of all bits, to HELL.

After falling to the floor and struggling with unconciousness for at least
2 hours, I realized that everything was gone. 212848274 bytes free. I
grabbed for the coke can, and it fell. To the wrong place. The sticky
liquid soaked the desk, and, the backup disks. General Failure, Abort,
Retry, commit Suicide? was the message I got when I tried to PkUnzip (R)
the files on the backup disk. The horror. The horror.

Then, I got all pissed off. I decided to get a life, not to hang around on
the keyboard 25 hours a day, trying to win the fight of the humans against
the computers and telcos. But, Onkel Dittmeyer would not be Onkel
Dittmeyer, if I would not have been lusting for a compiler and an editor
after a couple weeks. So, I blew the dust off the keyboard, fired up my
machine, and tried to seize parts of the source code from the physical
cylinders of my trusty drive. The result was a 5,9 MB large file called
ASH.BIN that contained about 25000 lines of pascal source, fragmented,
shattered, plus millions of control characters, parts from zip files,
and other junk.

I made my way through this garbage. A couple weeks, $600 on pizza home
delivery, and one School-You-Are-Fired letter later, BlueBEEP was back in
a hardly compilable shape. That got me high. I did it. 48 hours of non-
stop programming later, BlueBEEP was back in the shape where I had it
before the trojan asassin took place. I looked at the calendar on the
wall. November 9th, 1993. I looked over to the desk. And I saw it.
The ticket. SCANDINAVIAN SAS, HAM-LAX, 12/01/93, 0845. In less than
three weeks I would be on my way to california, and I should have
BlueBEEP ready to be released at the HoHoCon 3 weeks later in Texas.
No way I could program any further after 12/01/93, 0845. This was my
deadline. I glanced at my watch, and soaked in the tasty smoke from the
joint in my left hand. Lets go for it.

November 11th, the thrill came to a new max. My mom returned from her
3-week spain vacation, which she payed with money she stole me. That
raised my motivation like shit. It really gets you highly agressive
and motivated if you are staying with someone where you know, that she
will steal all your cash and sell your equipment if you go out for dinner.

Agressivity. That is the key word. Agressivity that causes a lion to
survive. Just like me. A line of coke. Ahhh. Onkel Dittmeyer on his
highest point of agressivity, motivation to kill. Or code, whatever way
you might put this. Eliminating bugs. Asassinating slack code. And
anything else that comes into my way. Groooan, I said, and put "Killing
Season" into my DAT tape deck. 777-095. "Sorry, we dont have pizza
with ripped-off baby heads, sir." Phuckups. Where's my M-60? Lets kill
this though, back to work. The Major Threat of the telcos is back, and
more fucking evil than ever before.

.TOPIC Frequencies
.SUBTITLE The technical aspect, or "whats that noise?"

Okay, when you are not clear how a "trunk" is set up, you should read
on here. Well, it's rather simple. You have 5 values in each line, these
are:
|C           Freq-1  Freq-2  Freq-3  Lenght  Delay
            |d(|BHz|d)    (|BHz|d)    (|BHz|d)    (|Bms|d)    (|Bms|d)

Freq1-3 will be overlaid (played at the same time) for a length of "Len"
milliseconds, followed by a pause (silence) of "Delay" milliseconds.
After this is done, it will proceed to the next line. If the next line is
empty, it's done, got it ?

With the dial sets, its just the same. It plays Freq1+2+3 for Len mili-
seconds, and then delays for the time you have set as the "dial speed"
in Action Mode.  The dial speed can be modified by pressing Cursor Left
and Right in Action Mode.

The Frequencies are generated through the FM chipset on your adlib
compatible sound card, again, the credits for the adlib frequency output
goes to Urmel.  There are no program-internal sinus tables, like in Blue
Dial, that just slow down all the shit stuff, the frequency generation
is handled 100% by the adlib sound card.

Compatible cards that will also work are:

- |CAdLib
- |CAdLib Gold
- |Call SoundBlaster and SoundBlaster Pro/Pro16 models
- |CAudioBlaster, all models

Thats it! I don't think that this is a big deal because adlib cards can
be bought for |C$20|c, and you should buy one real quick.

I personal like the SB/16 ASP most. 44k, Stereo, and feature-packed.

.TOPIC Usage
.SUBTITLE How to use this shit, keys, hints, etc.

Most of the functions are self-explaining for a real phreak, so
you should find out the most stuff yourself without having any
trouble. Watch the bottom line of the screen while wandering
through the menus, some useful information is often displayed there.

The |CDialTranslation|c feature should be also known; it works like
in BlueDial (Great Job, Casanova!). Just put a %x to put part x
of the number in, &x for part x to the end of the number. All
characters will be passed on as-is; spaces will be ignored.

So far for that. Now for the keys. Try it all out, and memorize
them carefully, because I did not waste much time putting online
help into the program. For example, in Action Mode only 10% of the
available features are acutally displayed on screen. Just read on.

In |CAction Mode|c, use the following keys:

|B  0|b..|B1|c                for digits
|B  A|b..|BH|c                for operator codes
|B  +|c                   for trunk
|B  ENTER|c               for current number
|B  F1|c                  to load new trunk, edit trunks in SETUP menu
|B  F2|c                  to load new dial set, edit dialsets in SETUP menu
|B  F5|c                  to take the hardware device off/onhook
|B  F6|c                  to switch play/record mode on hardware device
|B  F7|c                  to switch phone on/off on
|B  F8|c                  to hangup everything if you have device & phone
|B  F10|c                 for QUICK EXIT (to your terminal program maybe)
|B  CurLft/Rt|c           to change dial speed
|B  CurUp/Dn|c            to select a new number
|B  ESC|c                 to return to the main menu
|B  SPACE|c               to edit the current phone number
|B  Del|c                 to delete the current phone number
|B  P|c                   to pulse-dial the current phone number
|B  S|c                   to see debug status info
|B  ALT-M|c               to toggle device play/rec auto switching
|B  ALT-W|c               to see the World Time (set correct timezone 1st!)
|B  W|c                   to say "Please Wait", I found this to be useful
|B  Q|c                   to record quick sample
|B  R|c                   to replay quick sample
|B  M|c                   to modem-dial the current number
|B  ALT-S|c               to sort the phone book alphabetically


In |CScanning Mode|c, the stuff is sent in the following format:

|CBEFORESTRING|c+|CSCANSTUFF|c+|CAFTERSTRING

Got it ? If you turn AutoIncrease ON, the scanner will raise
the scan by one every time you press ENTER, if not, you will
have to do this yourself by pressing Cursor Up/Down.

In |CCardTalker Mode|c, use the following keys:

|B  F1|c     talks " I would like to make a call using my AT&T calling card "
|B  F2|c     talks " I would like to make a call using my MCI calling card "
|B  F3|c     talks " I would like to make a call using my Sprint Phonecard "
|B  F4|c     talks " The number I'm calling is "
|B  F5|c     talks the card number you can edit with F9
|B  F6|c     talks the fone number you can edit with F10
|B  F7|c     talks " I would like to place this call collect. "
|B  F8|c     talks " You're nothing more than a bucket of boiling shit! "
|B  F9|c     edits the current card number that's sent by pressing F5

|B  F6             |cSaves current settings into a selectable trunk
|B  F7             |cOn-The-Fly modification of whole break sequence
|B  F8             |cReset Trunk to "normal" trunk
|B  F9             |cZero Out Clear Forward
|B  F10            |cZero Out Seize
|B  Space          |cEdit Quick Test Number
|B  Enter          |cSend Quick Test Number

.TOPIC The Mouse
.SUBTITLE Stories about squeaky, gross things

Just Left-Click an menu item to open it.
Right-Click to close a menu, the right mouse button does almost the
same as the ESC key.

In Action mode, you can use the mouse to leftclick the numbers and
special keys to sound the tones, just like pressing the key itself.
If you want to click at function keys, click the function key number
in brackets.  You can also select new numbers by clicking at them.
Clicking the [Scroll Up] and [Scroll Down] buttons on the bottom of
the screen lets you scroll through the numbers. If you click at the
[CR] sign the current number is automatically dialed, just like the
key would do itself. To quit, either click the right mouse button
or click at the [ESC] sign in the bottom line of the screen.

In CardTalker mode, the mouse movement is locked to the function box,
just click on the line of the function you wish to use, or rightclick
to exit.

In this document reader, use the Left & Right buttons to scroll up and
down in the text. To quit reading, press both buttons at once.

By the way, I programmed the whole user interface myself, I used nothing
like toolboxes, or third-party TPUs. Everything and everything except the
adlib sound routines are my work, so if you encounter bugs with the user
interface tell me and it will be fixed. If you are a programmer and want
to use my user interface or parts of it, send me a mail.

.TOPIC Parameters
.SUBTITLE Command Line Parameters

BlueBEEP offers several command line parameters to make things easier.
Here is a detailed list:

 |B/?            |cShows avaiable command line parameters
 |B/(C)          |cDisplays source code information
 |B/A            |cStarts the program in Action Mode
 |B/S            |cStarts the program in Scanning Mode
 |B/R            |cStarts the program in Red Box Mode
 |B/T            |cStarts the program in CardTalker Mode
 |B/F            |cStarts the program in Frequency Tester Mode
 |B/C            |cStarts the program in CardChecker Mode *regged only*
 |B/TERM         |cStarts the program in tiny terminal mode
 |B/NOMODEM      |cDisables the modem usage, overrides the config
 |B/NOMOUSE      |cDisables mouse usage, even if a mouse is present
 |B/DEBUG        |cDisplays some debugging info
 |B/EXEC <fn>    |cExecutes BSLI script file <fn>

That's it so far. You cannot combine /A, /S, /R, /T, /F, /C and /TERM.
The options /NOMOUSE and /NOMODEM can be combined with any other command
line parameters.

You cannot combine /NOMODEM and /TERM, you idiot !

Note that you cannot use parameters when you have the password
protection on; this is a security feature.

.TOPIC The hardware
.SUBTITLE The BlueBEEP Pulse Dialing Hardware

From now, you can pulse dial with BlueBEEP, send the tones
DIRECTLY into the phone line, and many more. You can
powerdial at speeds never seen before...sounds k-rad huh?

All you need is a little piece of hardware that you have to
connect to your parallel port (printer port) and to your joy-
stick port (that's where it gets that 5V+ power that it needs
to operate). Then plug it into the blaster and the phone line..

If you are an elite phreaker and interested in that device,
email me for an assembly instruction or a ready-to-plug
device.

For all people that already have one, one quick note.
The german phone system can handle up to 35/30/300 timings,
but the TELEKOM will probably notice that you are powerdialing
and kick your ass, so use the defaults (50/50/500).

When pulse dialing, |C1-9|c are 1-9 tacks,
                    |C0|c    is 10 tacks,
                    |CA|c    is 11 tacks,
                    |CB|c    is 12 tacks,
                    |CC|c    is 13 tacks,
                    |CD|c    is 14 tacks,
                    |CE|c    is 15 tacks,
                    |CF|c    is 16 tacks,
                    |CG|c    is 17 tacks and
                    |CH|c    is 18 tacks.

You can use tacks over 10 to access the military phone system.
By the way, holding down the "O" button and listening to the
clicking relays is fun, but will fuck up your relays with the time.

For the HOOK relay we recommend you to use a high-quality relay,
because this is the most-used part in the device.

A soldering plan for the device is under development and will be
published in one of the next releases.

If you are into electronics and soldering, then you could just make
a little device with some relais on it. You should make Relay 0 control
the hook switch, Relay 1 control the play/rec condition of the phone
line transmitter, and let toggle relay 2 the phone/device switch.
You can then connect the device to any serial port and set it up in
the Setup/Pulse Dialing menu.

By the way, we have another cool device in development that can detect
incoming touch-tones as well. Means, you can use BlueBEEP as your ans-
werring machine, or as your own voice mail system. Killer? Killer!

For further information send Electronic Mail.

.TOPIC Script Language

|dƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ

BSLI is BlueBEEP's script language, that means that it is a tiny pro-
gramming language that can access all major functions of BlueBEEP just
by typing a little text. It is very powerful, or at least: It WILL become
powerful, after it was thrown back due to the big crash, and I was lacking
the time to finish it till HoHoCon.

Okay. Lets talk about the script format. Each command is a line of text.
Each blank line or a line starting with a |C;|c symbol will be ignored,
just like it wouldn't be there. Each other line is interpreted as code.

To run a BSLI script, call one of this commands:

        |CBSLI |B<scriptname>
        |CBLUEBEEP EXEC |B<scriptname>

where |B<scriptname>|c is the file name of the script you want to execute.
The BSLI.EXE is much smaller and handy if you want to give your scripts
away without the person having the full BlueBEEP at their hands.

|CCommands

Valid commands for the scripts are:

|CCLEAR_SCREEN
  This will clear the screen and put the cursor in the top left position.

|CWRITE |B<text>
  This will write the string |B<text> |con screen.

|CWRITELN |B<text>
  This will write the string |B<text> |con screen and proceed to the
  next line.

|CDIAL |B<number>
  This will dial the number |B<number> |cwithout any dial translation
  appearing to it, regardless to the DTL_Ineffect value. Valid characters
  in the number are 0123456789ACBDEFGH, other characters will just be
  ignored. Dialing will occur using the current dial set and -speed.

|CDELAY |B<miliseconds>
  This will halt (delay) the computer for the given time of
  |B<miliseconds>|c, eg. DELAY 5000 would wait 5 seconds and proceed
  with the next line in the script.

|CCHANGE_DIALSET |B<dialsetname>
  This will change the current dialset to |B<dialsetname>|c by loading
  the corresponding dial set from BLUEBEEP.SET and activating it. For
  example if you put DTMF after it it would switch BlueBEEP into touch
  tone mode. This is not case sensitive. Selecting an nonexisting dial
  set will result in a fatal error and cancellation of the script.

|CCHANGE_TRUNK |B<trunkname>
  This will change the current trunk (break tone) to |B<trunkname>|c.
  Almost the same as CHANGE_DIALSET.

|CFAST_EXIT
  This will exit the script to DOS at once. Almost the same as pressing
  F10 while in Action Mode.

|CWAIT_ENTER
  This will wait for the ENTER key to be pressed. No text will be
  displayed. If you want to notify the user of your actions first,
  be sure to put a WRITE statement in the above line.

|CPLAY_TRUNK
  This will play the currently loaded trunk; same as hitting |C+|c.
  Note that the last used trunk will be saved on exit and loaded as
  default when you run either BlueBEEP or BSLI.

|CMODEM_DIAL |B<number>
  This will dial the |B<number> |con the modem, corresponding to the
  current modem settings (pulse/tone) and the presence of a modem.
  You do NOT have to specify anything like ATDT; BSLI will do it auto-
  magically.

|CMODEM_DROP_DTR
  This will drop the DTR on the modem line and will abort any dialing
  in progress.

|CMODEM_RAISE_DTR
  This will raise the DTR on the modem line.

|CSEND_TONE |B<f1> <f2> <f3> <length>
  This will send tone |B<f1>,<f2>,<f3> |cfor |B<length> |cmiliseconds,
  if you need delay between the tones, take advantage of the |CDELAY
  routine.

That's it so far! I am currently working on variables and new commands,
so you can be sure that you get something to play with when I release
the soon-to-come BlueBEEP V0.08 in the next couple of weeks!

Enjoy!
